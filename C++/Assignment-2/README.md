* Assignment 2: 
  - Object-oriented programming of a linked list
  - The aim of this internship is to create a program for processing the entries in a linked list of strings while at the same time managing a queue (FIFO). The functionality is to be demonstrated in a main program.
  - A linked list is a sequence of data elements for which a pointer to the next element is created in addition to the data to be managed. "First" is a pointer to the first element. In addition to the data, a pointer to the successor element is created for each list element; the last element contains a specified value as an address that cannot be interpreted as a valid address (= NULL).
